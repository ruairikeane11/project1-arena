 Colours
 -
 I used 3 main colors in this project. White, black and red rgba(241, 109, 109). This is because red is associated with evoking emotions and increasing stimulation.


Fonts
-
The primary font that i used throughout this website was Oswald. This is because the font is captivating and it catches the viewers attention, which is one of the main goals of the website.

I also used the Lato font in some parts of the page, for example, in the menu section Lato was used to represent different pages in the website. This is because it is not essential information for the viewer. Therefore the lesser captivating font, Lato was used.

Icons:
-
The icons that were used in this project  were taken from wwww.fontawesome.com.The icons are located in the footer and they provide links to social media platoforms.



Images:

The site does rely heavily on images. The home page includes three images. The hero image is striking and captures the attention of the viewer. The second image is found in the rules section. It is a small circluar image. The third image is used as a background image on the bottom of the page. 



The gallery section contains several images. The page is responsive and the column-count of photographs will increase as the viewing screen size increases also.

 For this project, I took a lot of inspiration from the Love Running walkthrough project. I incorporated the general structure of the Love running website into my own. For example, I included a home page, a gallery page, and a sign-up page. 

For the competition dates section, I used a similar design to that of the Love Running meet up times section.

For my project. I customised the code to make the divs appear in a different way to the love running project on different screen sizes. I also used my own image and text. Below, you can see how I used media queries to make the content appear different on 3 different screen sizes.

 I also took inspiration from the Love Running sign-up pages 


 
For my own sign up page. I used a form element with different inputs like a select box and a radiobutton. I also used my own image as the background. I added a transperant red color as the background color for the sign-up box to create contarst on the page.
