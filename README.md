Visual Design

Wireframes:
I used https://balsamiq.com to construct a general structure for my home page (image-1.png)

Fonts:

The primary font that i used throughout this website was Oswald. This is because the font is captivating and it catches the viewers attention, which is one of the main goals of the website.

I also used the Lato font in some parts of the page, for example, in the menu section Lato was used to represent different pages in the website. This is because it is not essential information for the viewer. Therefore the lesser captivating font, Lato was used.


Icons:

The icons that were used website were taken from wwww.fontawesome.com.The icons are located in the footer and they provide links to social media platoforms.
