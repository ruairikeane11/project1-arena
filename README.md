### Wireframes 
#### Sketching 
I started creating mock-ups of my intended website design by hand. I experimented with different designs and layouts on desk-tops and mobiles.

#### Balsamiq 
After creating mock-ups by hand I used Balsamiq to create more wireframes. I started to play around with different images as the hero image.

## Colours
I used 3 main colors in this project. White(#FAFAFA), black(#3A3A3A) and red rgba(241, 109, 109). I found the contrast of these 3 colours captivating, ultimately fitting with the overall theme of combat sports.

## Fonts

![alt text](pictures/image-5.png)

### Oswald
The primary font that i used throughout this website was Oswald. This is because the font is captivating and it catches the viewers attention, which is one of the main goals of the website.

### Lato 
I also used the Lato font in some parts of the page, for example, in the menu section Lato was used to represent different pages in the website. This is because it is not essential information for the viewer. Therefore the lesser captivating font, Lato, was used. Both font styles were imported from Google Fonts.

## Icons:
The icons that were used in this project  were taken from (https://fontawesome.com) The icons are located in the footer and they provide links to social media platoforms.

The site includes many images. The home page includes three images. The hero image is striking and captures the attention of the viewer. The second image is found in the rules section. It is a small circluar image. The third image is used as a background image on the bottom of the page.

# 4. Credits :
## Love Running Walkthrough Project
For this project, I took a lot of inspiration from the Love Running walkthrough project. I incorporated the general structure of the Love running website into my own. For example, I included a home page, a gallery page, and a sign-up page. I customised my website to fit my intended design while keeping the same general structure as the Love Running Project, as I thought it worked well with the features I wanted to include.

## Mentor Tutor Sessions - Rory Sheridan
I found my three meetings with my mentor tutor very helpful in the completion of this project. In each session I received feedback on my work, and Rory was able to assist me in terms of time managment and efficiency.
